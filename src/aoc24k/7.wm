Fun day! For part 2, I used a slightly odd concatenation function. This is because it works on a list x and scalar y, and not just scalar x and y. I found that by going from an explicit (previously, I was using eachright) to an implicit loop like this, I sped up my solution by a factor of ten.

P.S. ngn/k is a beast for being able to brute force this (I'm not doing anything clever) in 100 ms
